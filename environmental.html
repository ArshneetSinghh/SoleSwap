A classic look to stay with you for many years, SoleSwap uses only ethical manufacturing, recycled packaging and carbon neutral shipping. <br>

  <h1>Fast fashion and sustainable shoes.What to look for when shopping for sustainable shoes?



  It is no secret that the fashion business has not always been the most environmentally friendly. It is currently regarded as one of the world's biggest pollutants. Harmful colours from textiles can leak into groundwater in inadequately sealed landfills, causing extensive environmental impact. To effect change and advance the use of sustainable fashion in the future SoleSwap uses natural colours to counteract the fast fashion industry and stays away from polyester and other synthetic, plastic-based materials that have been shown to contaminate our waterways and the ocean.
  <br> <br>
  Consumer-facing sustainable fashion initiatives although it would appear that since we aren't fashion businesses there isn't much we can do to improve the industry, that isn't the case. You have more influence than you may think as a customer.

  <h1>The environmental impact of sneaker production  </h1>

  The World Footwear Yearbook estimates that approximately 24 billion pairs of shoes are manufactured yearly (mostly in conditions that are exploitative), with sneakers making up the greatest portion.
  <br><br>
  Why is it so difficult to cut down on plastic use? The durability factor is crucial for sneakers since they must withstand significantly more wear and tear than a typical pair of shoes. Unfortunately, synthetic materials perform better than organic ones when it comes to durability. Shoes are now better, lighter, quicker, more comfortable, and more widely available thanks to plastic. But another issue is that the majority of shoes are produced from a mix of several polymers that are sewn and bonded in extremely intricate ways, making them very difficult to recycle.

  <h1>What do brands do to address their environmental impact? </h1>

  Tansy Hoskins, author of the book Foot Work: What Your Shoes are Doing to the World, claims that the footwear business is at least 10 years behind the rest of the fashion sector in terms of human rights and environmental norms.


  <h1>The benefits of buying eco shoes </h1>

  The environmental impact in the production of organic and eco-sustainable shoes is minimal and even those who wear this type of shoes benefit from it. The human foot 'recognizes' the materials used and suffers less, often the bio shoes also mitigate states of chronic sweating, since the absorption of sweat by the fabrics used is optimal.
  Do not forget that organic shoes are also durable, as they are made with the utmost care of craftsmanship. Therefore you can feel as a responsible. We are dedicated to producing world-class footwear using unique ecological resources.

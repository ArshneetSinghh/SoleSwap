  <h1> Frequently Asked Questions  </h1>

  Question: What is the clear view sole made from? <br>
  Answer: Thermoplasticized rubber is used to create our clear view sole (TPR). TPR is a fantastic option because it is produced without PVC and does not require the use of BPA. On teethers and the spouts of Sippy cups, TPR is typically utilised in regions that require a lot of "rubber." Since we are aware that everything might end up in a child's mouth, what better material could we use to manufacture our soles?
  <br><br>

  SoleSwap has come up with an idea that they have created something quite interesting that has not been seen before with any other brand. If you buy a SoleSwap shoe pair then you will be able to swap the sole of your shoes and attach that sole with any other combination. <br><br>
  By just changing the sole of your shoes you can make different types of shoes like for playing sports you can convert them into sports shoes, going for meetings convert them into formal shoes, when going to a party you can convert them into sneakers. <br><br>
  Instead of throwing out your favorite pair of sneakers when the soles wear out just replace the bottom with new soles. SoleSwap shoes are not only for males but for females as well. <br><br>
  One of the unique selling propositions of SoleSwap is that if you use these shoes while running, you will feel the soles could pop off, but the shoes are made very well that they will not detach. Many other brands have copied the same thing from SoleSwap but they were unable to create such shoes. <br><br>
  Talking about the sole of SoleSwap it comprises magnetic locks that can easily pair the upper part of your shoes. The life of these magnetic locks is also up to 2 years and replacement cost is very minimal as well. <br><br>
  The most important feature of this product that every consumer wants is price, talking about the price if you buy a good quality shoe then it will cost you about 3000 but in the case of SoleSwap you can easily get them within 1500 with different soles. <br><br>
  If you've ever bemoaned the loss of a favorite worn-out sneaker or sandal that's no longer in stores, you'll appreciate the chance to revive them with new soles. Style-conscious consumers might also enjoy being able to match their outfits with different color soles.  <br><br>

  So what are you waiting for? Order your pair of SoleSwap right now and show off in front of your friends right away! <br><br>

<h1>  Why SoleSwap?
    ----The history and the emotional connect </h1>
  <br> <br>

  When I was a young kid, my parents were very poor. We lived in a small house in a deserted part of Rajasthan where the temperature could reach up to 50 degrees! Trust me, it's very hot. My mother use to travel 50kms every day to the nearest water reservoir to get some water. Her feet were red, so red that now walking barefoot didn’t hurt her anymore.
  <br> <br>
  My father was a very jolly person. He was a big foodie and always asks for variety. He was a farmer, running a 50-acre farm, all by himself. He use to leave at 6:30 AM and use to come back at 7:00 pm. It was more demanding than corporate people's 9-5 jobs. He always preferred to do farming barefoot because he thought that shoes were very expensive, and for a few hundred/thousand rupees, you get only one pair of shoes.
  <br> <br>
  Every day we ate dinner together, we laughed and talked, and we didn't realize the memories we created together. Little did I knew that one of these dinner nights would inspire me to make something unique.
  <br> <br>
  As I was leaving for school one day, my parents gave me a box. It was beautifully packed and with a bow made out of jute rope. When I opened it, I found a beautiful pair of shoes. I was delighted! “Thank you maa and paa,” I said, in a teary voice. My paa told me, "You can wear them today, and I will wear them tomorrow.". My maa laughed and said “He was planning to wear them today but I forced him to let you wear them first.” We all laughed. I was elated. I wore those shoes to school and everyone noticed. I was running, dancing, and going up and down the stairs basically, I was enjoying every step I took. But suddenly, I felt some air rushing into my shoes. I looked down and my shoes were broken. I was in shock. I sat down to understand the gravity of the situation. The thought of my maa and paa kept coming into my mind. I shed a tear as I recalled my paa saying, "I'll wear them tomorrow", and my maa saying, "Let him wear them today.". I knew the financial condition of my family. I was devastated and didn't know how I would handle them.
  <br> <br>
  When I reached home, my dad was already there, sitting with my mom, talking. They both saw me and the moment it happened, I felt guilty. It felt like I have committed a crime and I should be punished for it. I started crying.
  <br> <br>
  They got worried and didn't understood what was going on. They asked me what happened but I was weeping like a kid. It took me a minute to get normal then I said, “I am sorry paa, I broke my shoe. But trust me it was an accident.”
  <br> <br>
  My parents started laughing. I was confused and nervous. Then my maa said, “It's okay Arshneet. I know you didn’t do it on purpose. “But I wanted paa to wear these shoes tomorrow to his work. Now they are broken and he can’t wear them.”,  I said with a sad voice.  My paa looked at me and said, “Its okay son. When you grow up, you should make a shoe that can be replaced in case one part of the shoe gets damaged.” We embraced and headed to dinner. He said this statement to lighten the mood but I took it very seriously. And that was the day that inspired me to make this brand and to sell footwear with replaceable soles and uppers.
  <br> <br>

  When I made SoleSwap, I kept my dad’s thoughts in my mind. I wanted people to have variety. We worked hard to achieve it, and it was a success. Now SoleSwap provides shoes that have replaceable soles and uppers. You can convert your shoes to flat heels, flip-flops, sports shoes, and whatnot!
  <br> <br>
  I’m 100 percent sure that my father, even though he's not with me anymore, is watching me from heaven and is very proud of me. Thank you maa and paa for giving me this idea.
